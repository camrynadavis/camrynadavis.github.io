Analyzing the correlation between youth sports participation opportunities and accessibility of recreational facilities. 

In the most recent State of Play report conducted by the Aspen Institute, key findings suggested a connection between income and sports participation. For instance, while states such as Vermont, New Hampshire, Iowa, and Maine reported the highest percentage of youth sports participation (over 63%), some of the poorest states in the U.S. – New Mexico, Mississippi, Louisiana – reported below average participation (under 54%). More youth are returning to sports post-COVID, but opportunities for sports participation and physical activity seem to be dependent on various socioeconomic and geographic factors. This is analyzed through utilizing GIS.
